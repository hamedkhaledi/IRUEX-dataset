This could prevent farmers from losing their valuable livestock and stop them from trying to kill the cheetahs.\nLooking for solutions based on animal behavior could work for other species too.

This is what we did with our research. We tracked the cheetah's behavior. We noticed that the cheetahs did not move their area to go after the calves. We thought that if the farmers kept their groups of cows with calves in certain areas, and not in others, they could avoid cheetah attacks. The farmers took our advice. They then compared the number of calves killed by cheetahs before and after these changes. So, did our advice work? Yes! The farmers observed a significant reduction in calves killed by cheetahs. This could prevent farmers from losing their valuable livestock and stop them from trying to kill the cheetahs.\nLooking for solutions based on animal behavior could work for other species too.

As a student, despite his struggles with subjects like reading and writing, Dave found ways to improve his memory in order to do well in school. In 2008, he set a world record by memorizing the order of 59 decks of playing cards in two days. How did his brain store all of this information? According to Dave, anybody's brain can do it, but it helps to understand how memory works.\nYour short-term memory can only hold information from 15 seconds to a few minutes. In addition, short-term memory can only hold about seven things at one time. Memory champions like Dave have to hold long lists of information in their short-term memory at one time. To do this, they rely on different tricks.\nOne trick is to look at the first letter of every word you want to memorize. Then, create your own word, phrase or sentence using all of those letters. This is called an acronym. For example, if you want to remember all the colors in a rainbow, try remembering the rame Roy G. Biv.
