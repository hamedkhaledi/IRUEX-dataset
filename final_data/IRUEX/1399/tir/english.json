        "full_text": "PASSAGE 1:A kind of bird known as pigeons have been taught to recognize human facial expressions, weakening longheld beliefs that only humans have the sophisticated nervous systems to perform such an act. In some recent experiments, eight trained pigeons were shown photographs of people displaying emotions of happiness, anger, surprise, and hatred. The birds learned to recognize the difference between these expressions. Not only that, but they were also able to correctly identify the same expressions on photographs of unfamiliar faces. Their achievement does not suggest, of course, that the pigeons had any idea what the human expressions meant.Some psychologists have theorized that because of the importance of facial expression to human communication, humans developed special nervous systems capable of recognizing subtle expressions. The pigeons cast doubt on that idea, however, In fact, the ability to recognize facial expressions of emotion is not necessarily inborn even in human babies, but may have to be learned in much the same way pigeons learn. In experiments conducted several years ago, it was found that pigeons organize images of things into the same logical categories that humans do.\nThe passage suggests that the belief that animals may also be able to recognize facial expressions ......... .\n\nOptions:\nA) proves that they understand what each facial expression means\nB) holds true in relation to trained, but not untrained, birds\nC) was supposed to be wrong\nD) is a long-held one",
