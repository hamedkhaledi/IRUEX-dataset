مقدّمه

با استعانت از الطاف خداوند متعال و عنایات حضرت ولي عصر (عج الله تعالي فرجه الشریف)
سوّمین جلد از مجموعه کتاب‌های Vision به منظور تدریس در پایهٔ دوازدهم تحصیلی، تألیف
گردیده و هم اکنون پیش روی شماست. آموزش زبان‌های خارجی و به‌طور ویژه آموزش زبان
انگلیسی در نظام رسمی آموزش و پرورش کشورمان در سال‌های اخیر شاهد تحوّلی بنیادین
و اساسی بوده است که ریشه در تحوّل کلّی نظام آموزش و پرورش، اجرای سند برنامهٔ درسی
ملّی و سند تحوّل بنیادین نظام تعلیم و تربیت جمهوری اسلامی دارد و در چارچوب رویکرد
ارتباطی فعّال و خودباورانهٔ مورد تصریح در برنامهٔ ملّی محقّق شده است. در رویکرد ارتباطی
فعّال و خودباورانه، زبان‌های خارجی، از جمله زبان انگلیسی، به منظور ایجاد ارتباط با جهان
به شیوه‌ای فعّال و با تأکید بر ارزش‌ها و داشته‌های فرهنگ غنی اسلامی و ایرانی فراگیران
آموزش داده می‌شود.

تحوّل در آموزش زبان انگلیسی در قالب ارائهٔ مجموعه کتاب‌های English for Schools
و از سال تحصیلی ۱۳۹۲-۱۳۹۱ آغاز گشت. مجموعهٔ مذکور دوره‌ای شش جلدی شامل
دو زیر مجموعهٔ سه جلدی با نام‌های Prospect و Vision می‌باشد. مهم‌ترین ویژگی‌های
رویکرد ارتباطی فعّال و خودباورانه و روح کلی حاکم بر مجموعه بسته‌های آموزشی Prospect
و Vision متکی بر اصول کلی زیر است:

توجّه هم‌زمان به هر چهار مهارت زبانی (گوش دادن، صحبت کردن، خواندن و نوشتن)
استفاده از فعّالیت‌های آموزشی متنوع در فرایند یادگیری زبان
تأکید بر یادگیری زبان از طریق تجربیات زبانی

استفاده از محتوای غنی، معنادار و قابل فهم در تدوین محتوای آموزشی

ارتقای روحیهٔ فراگیری زبان در محیط مشارکتی و از طریق همکاری و همیاری در کلاس
ارائهٔ بازخوردهای اصلاحی مناسب به خطاهای فراگیران
توجّه به جنبه‌های عاطفی و نقش آنها در فرایند آموزش زبان

----------

نکات قابل توجه دبیران گرامی:

نخستین توصیهٔ ما به همکاران گرامی این است که در آغاز تدریس این مجموعه، حتماً برنامهٔ
درسی ملّی و حوزهٔ مربوط به آموزش زبان‌های خارجی این سند را به دقّت مطالعه نمایند تا با
سمت و سو و سیاست‌های اصلی و مبنایی آموزش زبان‌های خارجی در این سند مهم که نقشهٔ
راه نظام آموزشی کشور است بیشتر آشنا شوند.

توصیهٔ دوم این است که کتاب‌های Prospect یک تا سه (دورهٔ اوّل متوسطه) را ملاحظه
نموده و با مطالعهٔ کتاب راهنمای معلم آن کتاب‌ها و مشاهدهٔ فیلم‌های آموزشی دبیران با
عنوان «برفراز آسمان» با اصول تدریس بر اساس رویکرد ارتباطی فعّال و خودباورانه آشنایی
کامل پیدا کنند. مطالعهٔ کتاب‌های فوق به فهم دقیق سطح فعلی دانش آموزان، کمک شایان
توجهی می‌کند.

همچنین از همکاران گرامی خواهشمندیم کتاب راهنمای معلم مربوط به مجموعه
کتاب‌های Vision را با توجه و دقت هر چه تمام‌تر مطالعه نمایند. به این شکل بسیاری از
پرسش‌ها و ابهامات احتمالی دربارهٔ شیوهٔ تدریس کتاب، نحوهٔ زمان‌بندی و فعّالیت‌های جنبی
برطرف می‌شود. مجدداً تأکید می‌کنیم تدریس درست و مؤثر این کتاب بدون مطالعهٔ کتاب
راهنمای معلم آن، امکان‌پذیر نیست.

توصیهٔ دیگر، توجه به هر چهار مهارت زبانی، به صورت هم‌زمان است که تحقق این مهم
نیز مستلزم آشنایی با نحوهٔ صحیح تدریس و طراحی درسی دقیق می‌باشد. علاوه بر کتاب
راهنمای معلم، مشاهدهٔ نرم‌افزار و فیلم آموزشی معلمان با نام «بر فراز آسمان» نیز بسیار مفید
خواهد بود. (در وبگاه گروه درسی زبان‌های خارجی یا شبکه ملّی مدارس (رشد) موجود است).
همچنین شایسته است والدین نیز از تغییر و تحوّلات انجام شده در نظام آموزش زبان
انگلیسی آگاه گردند و به این منظور پیشنهاد می‌شود با استفاده از ظرفیت جلسات ویژهٔ تعامل
والدین با مدرسه،دربارهٔ این تحولات، اطلاع‌رسانی لازم انجام گیرد.

لازم به یادآوری است که مجموعهٔ غنی و کاملی از منابع مورد نیاز همکاران از جمله فایل‌های
تمامی اجزای بستهٔ آموزشی، مجموعهٔ دستورالعمل‌ها و آئین‌نامه‌های مربوطه و جدیدترین
اخبار و اطلاعات مورد نیاز همکاران گرامی از طریق وبگاه گروه زبان‌های خارجی دفتر تألیف
تاب‌های درسی به نشانی زیر قابل دستیابی است که بازدید مرتب از این پایگاه نیز اکیداً توصیه
می‌شود. یادآوری می‌گردد دبیران گرامی و دانش‌آموزان محترم می‌توانند فایل صوتی (کتاب
گویا) را از وبگاه زیر تهیه نمایند.

Roshd.ir یا eng-dept.talif.sch.ir

----------

در خاتمه مجدداً تأکید می‌شود که بستهٔ آموزشی حاضر با حاکمیت رویکرد ارتباطی فعّال و
خودباورانه، جنبه‌های متنوع نیازهای آموزشی دانش‌آموزان را در نظر داشته و در کنار کتاب
دانش‌آموز با ارائهٔ کتاب کار، کتاب راهنمای معلم، فایل صوتی کتاب (کتاب گویا) و همچنین
فیلم آموزش معلمان (بر فراز آسمان)، مجموعهٔ کاملی را در اختیار فراگیران قرار داده است.
نکتهٔ پایانی این که طبق ضوابط مصوّب وزارت آموزش و پرورش، در صورت نیاز، تنها استفاده
از کتاب‌ها و منابع کمک آموزشی تأئید شده توسط طرح سامان بخشی کتاب‌های کمک
آموزشی دفتر تکنولوژی و انتشارات کمک آموزشی سازمان پژوهش و برنامه‌ریزی آموزشی
مجاز می‌باشد.

بی‌شک تحقق اهداف مورد نظر این بستهٔ آموزشی نیازمند حمایت‌های همه‌جانبه و ارزشمند
همکاران گرامی است که در سراسر ایران اسلامی با دلسوزی و تلاش فراوان، زمینهٔ رشد و
بالندگی آینده‌سازان میهن عزیزمان را فراهم می‌آوردند، مؤلفان، این تلاش ارزشمند را ارج نهاده
و آرزومند اعتلای روزافزون نام مقدّس جمهوری اسلامی ایران در تمامی عرصه‌ها هستند.

On a spring morning, an old woman was sitting on the sofa in her
house. Her young son was reading a newspaper. Suddenly a pigeon sat
on the window,

The mother asked her son quietly, "What is this?" The son replied:
"It is a pigeon". After a few minutes, she asked her son for the second
time, "What is this?" The son said, "Mom, I have just told you, "It is a
pigeon, a pigeon". After a little while, the old mother asked her son for
the third time, "What is this?" This time the son shouted at his mother,
«Why do you keep asking me the same question again and again? Are
you hard of hearing?"

A little later, the mother Went to her room and came back with an
old diary. She said, "My dear son, I bought this diary when you were
born". Then, she opened a page and kindly asked her son to read
that page. The son looked at the page, paused and
started reading it aloud:

Suddenly the son burst into tears, hugged his old mother and said
repeatedly, "Mom, mom, forgive me; please forgive me." The old
woman hugged her son, kissed him and said calmly, "We must care
for those who once cared for us. We all know how parents cared for
their children for every little thing. Children must love them, respect
them, and care for them".

Question generation

Question generation is a reading comprehension strategy
whereby readers ask and answer meaningful questions about
the important points or main ideas of a text. Using this strategy,
students ask and answer their own questions rather than only
answering questions provided by the book or the teacher.
Follow these steps:
1. Read the +ex+,

2. Find the important points or main ideas.
3. Make a question for each point or idea.
4. Answer the questions.

Common question starters along with their possible answers are

as follows;

Question Starter
Wh

Possible Answer

| Peson  |   |
| Object, Description or Process  | Wha+  |

C0uc

A collocation is two or more words that often go together. Collocations
tell us which words can come before or after other words. These
combinations just sound "right' to native speakers, who use them all the
time. On the other hand, other combinations may be unnatural and just
sound 'wrong'.

ꪪ fast food but quick meal. It would not be normal to say quick food
or fast meal.

o strong wind but heavy rain. It Would not be normal to say heaxywind
or strong rain.

ꪪ make a mistake but do exercise. It would not be normal to say do a
mistake or make exBrCise.

Or in the Reading, you can see the following collocations:
o read a newspaper (NOT study a newspaper)
sit on the sofa (NOT sit at the sofa)

hard of hearing (NOT diffieult of hearing)

----------

A. Without looking back at the Conversation, make collocations by
matching the words on the left with the ones on the right column.

| abroad  |   | 1, {cel  |

A sentence with more than one subject, more than one verb and a
connecting word such as and, or, but or so is called a compound
sentence.

a. Why is knowing about the experience of our parents important?

b. Why are our parents our first teachers?

2. Listen again and write down three important points mentioned.

B. Now read the rest.

Yet another important thing is our heritage and culture. We have much to learn
from our parents regarding our heritage, to be proud of our past. This heritage
and history brings a sense of belonging. Most importantly, it brings us a sense of
identity of our past and the responsibility to protect it for our future generations.
What I can add at the end is the role of our parents' morals, values, and principles
in our lives. Our elders have either learned, created or have been brought up with
a set of morals, values and principles in their lives. Our elders want the best for
us and they are willing to tell us what set of rules and guidelines have made them
successful, and hopefully, peaceful.

3. Underline all 'passive tenses'. Make three questions about the
important points. Then answer them.
C. Work in pairs. Ask and answer.

Interesting Facts:

The first Persian dictionary was compiled around 1000 years ago.

The largest dictionary in the world took 134 years to complete
(from 1864 to 1998).

Around 4,000 new words are added to the English dictionary
every year.

Excuse me Mr. Iranmehr, I wonder if you could help

Mr. Iranmehr: Sure. How can I help you?

Majid:

I'd like some information about a good English
dictionary.

Mr. Iranmehr: Oh, well. Have you ever used a dictionary?

Majid:

Actually, I haven't. But I've heard that using a good
dictionary can really help me learn English better.

Mr. Iranmehr: That's right. First, I recommend a learner's dictionary.

Majid:

What is a learner's dictionary?

Mr. Iranmehr: It is designed for foreign students. It also helps them
learn English better.

A good dictionary gives the user information about words such as
spellings, pronunciations and definitions. It also gives examples of
how to use the words in sentences correctly. Therefore, it is essential
to know how to use a dictionary. In this lesson, we provide you with
some helpful tips on how to use a dictionary effectively.

1. Choose the Right Dictionary. There are many different types of
dictionaries such as learner's dictionaries, general dictionaries, picture
dictionaries, etc. Therefore, first identify your needs. Without choosing
the right one you cannot meet your language needs.

2. Read the Introduction. The best way to learn how to use your
dictionary effectively is to read its introduction. This section explains
issues like how entries are arranged, what information is offered in
entries and what abbreviations and pronunciation symbols are used
throughout the entries.

3. Learn the Abbreviations. Different types of abbreviations are
often used in the defini

4. Learn the Guide to Pronunciation. If you immediately jump into
using the dictionary without understanding the pronunciation guide, it
can be difficult to figure it out.

5. Read the Guide Words. These are the two words at the top of each
page that show the first and last entries on the page. These words will
help you find the word you are looking for in the right letter section.
6. Read the Definitions. Once you find an entry, you can find the exact
meaning of the word, its pronunciation, part of speech, synonyms,
antonyms, and probably its origin.

7. Look for Collocations. Learning the meaning of a single word is
not usually enough. Through sentence examples, try to learn 'words in
combination' to expand your vocabulary.



Highlighting



One way to remember what you have read is to highligh
important information. Use these guidelines for highlighting
a text:

- Highlight the main ideas.

- Highlight the key points not minor details or less important
information.

- Highlight phrases and parts of sentences instead of entire
sentences.

- Do not highlight many sentences or too much of the text.

----------

A. Read the following paragraph and highlight the most important
information.

Sharks are not all the same. In fact, there are nearly 400
different kinds. Most sharks never attack_people. Only a
special group of sharks can be dangerous. They kill an average
of forty people every year. Let's compare sharks with snakes.
Snakes kill about 60,000 people every year. And let's not
forget that people kill 25,000,000 sharks every year

B. Now go back to the 'Reading'. It claims that you can be familiar
with useful information to use a dictionary more effectively. Highlight
parts of the passage that support this claim.

C. Read the 'Reading'. Generate questions with the following question
Starters and then ans

wORD PART FAMLLIEs

One way to figure out the meaning of an unknown word is to look
for its relationship with other words in the same family. Even
if you cannot figure out the exact meaning, your understanding
can be enough to allow you to read on. For example, in this
sentence;

«We provide you with some helpful information on how to use
a dictionary more effectively"

you can get an idea of the meaning of the word effectively by
recognizing that it is related to the word effect.

In this technique which is also known as word attack, looking
for word parts can help you read and understand the meaning of
complicated words. When you recognize prefixes and suffixes
and know what they mean, it will help you work out the meaning
of many words you read.

----------

A. Look at the following sentences. Write down at least one other word
you know that is related to the bold word.
My job has become increasingly difficult.

He wasn'+ very communicative and kept to himself.

The police believe the fire was started accidentally. و

The pollution is endangering the crops. و

We searched unsuccessfully for a map of Kerman. و

B. Attack these words to figure out their meanings. Try to write down
other words related to them. For example:

disconnection:

disconnec+/ connection/ connec+

= unsystematically:
= incomprehensible:
= unexpectedly:
international;

= unchangeable:

The first Persian dictionary which is still_published was compiled
more than 900 years ago. Loghat-e Fors was made by Asadi Tusi
who was a famous_poet in the 5th century. The list of entries has
been arranged according to the final letters of the words. There are
example sentences which were taken from_poetry. The dictionary
has synonyms and explanations that were used by young poets. This
dictionary has been used widely by the poets who lived after Asadi
Tusi. Many words have been added to the first dictionary which Asadi
compiled. The dictionary has been published several times and is a
valuable treasure of Persian language.

Paragraph

What is a paragraph?

A paragraph is a group of sentences about one idea. A paragraph can
(1) give us information, (2) tell us an opinion, (3) explain something
to us, or (4) tell us a short story. Every sentence in a paragraph is about
the same idea. When you want to write about a new idea, begin a new
paragraph.

Paragraph format

Paragraphs have a special shape. In each paragraph, the sentences
are grouped together. They come one after another. Remember that
sentences in a paragraph start with a capital letter and end with a
period (.), question mark (?) or exclamation point (!).

The most important sentence in a paragraph is the 'topic sentence'.
It is called the 'topic sentence' because it tells readers what they are
going to read about.

A topic sentence has two parts:

1. A topic: what the paragraph is about,

2. A controlling idea: what the writer is going to focus on it in the
paragraph.

For example:

Topic sentence 1: My sister and I respect our parents all the time.

controlling idea

Topic sentence 2: A cheetah is a wild animal from the cat family.

B. Look at the topic sentences from paragraphs you have seen in Vision 2.
Find the topic and the controlling idea.

1) Language is a system of communication.

2) About fifty percent of the world's languages have fewer than 5000

speakers.

3) Bad habits and addiction can be harmful to health.

4) Art is what people create with imagination and skill.

5) Handicrafts are good examples of the art and culture of a country.

5

----------

The topic sentence is usually the first or sometimes the last sentence,
but it can be any sentence in the paragraph.

Read the following paragraphs. First find the topic sentence,
then circle the topic, and underline the controlling idea.

1. Ants are found everywhere in the world. They make their home
in buildings, gardens, etc. They live in anthills. Ants are very
hardworking insects. Throughout the summers they collect food for
the winter season. Whenever they find a sweet on the floor, they
stick to the sweet and carry it to their home. Thus, in this way, they
clean the floor. Ants are generally red and black in colour. They
have two eyes and six legs. They are social insects.

2. The stars are tiny points of light in the space. On a clear night we
can see around 2,000 to 3,000 stars without using a telescope. Stars
look tiny in the sky because they are far away from the Earth. In
ancient times the sky watchers found patterns of stars in the sky.

3. An online dictionary is one that is available on the Internet or World
Wide Web and is accessed through a Web browser using a computer
or a mobile device, primarily by typing a term into a search box on
the site. Online dictionaries offer immediate, direct access through
large databases to a word's spelling and meanings, plus a host of
information, including its spellings, pronunciation, and origin, etc.

4. A hearing device is available for some people suffering from hearing
loss. This device uses a magnet. Like other aids, it converts sounds
into vibrations and transmits them directly to the magnet, and then
to the inner ear, producing a clearer sound. The device helps those
with a hearing loss caused by infection or other problems in the
middle ear,

C. Write a topic sentence for the following items.
1) sport

Eqrth for our Children

Energy is the ability to do work. It can take a variety of forms:
mechanical, electrical, chemical, and nuclear. To produce any type of
energy, the resources of the earth are used. The main resources of the
earth are fossil fuels such as natural gas, oil, and coal.

We get most of our energy from these fossil fuels, but this is harmful to
the environment. Fossil fuels are nonrenewable and canot be replaced
easily. Once we use them up, they're gone forever. They are not clean
as they pollute water or air.

In recent years, scientists try to use other types of energy resources.
They call them clean energy resources because they do not pollute the
earth. Clean energy is renewable. It is made from resources that can be
replaced, like wind, water, sunshine, tides, and plants. When renewable
energy resources are used, the demand for fossil fuels is reduced.
The most common type of clean energy is the solar power. Solar
energy is produced by the radiation that reaches the earth. People
have used the sun as a heat Source for thousands of years. Iranians, for
instance, use special designs and arrangements of windows, balconies
and yards to get the most sunshine. Different types of materials might
also be used in building the houses. This keeps people warm during
cold seasons and cool during hot days of the year.

Nowadays, solar energy can be converted into other forms of energy,
such as heat and electricity. Solar energy might be used
for heating water and air in homes,

----------

buildings, or swimming pools. Maybe you've seen buildings or houses
with big shiny panels on the roof. These are solar collectors that
collect heat by absorbing sunlight and producing solar power. Also,
solar energy can be used in generating electricity to provide power for
watches, highway signs, houses and even space stations.

Clean energy resources are widely used in many countries to keep
cities and villages clean. As a result, fewer fossil fuels are consumed
each year and they are saved for the future generations.

Note taking CD a

Learning to take good notes is very important. Good notes can help
you remember and review a text you have read. There is no magic
formula to taking notes when reading.You have to find out what
works best for you. However, the following guidelines are suggested:
Be sure to include all the important ideas and examples.
Write only important words, not complete sentences
Use abbreviations and symbols.

You can write your notes in the margins or on a separate page.For
example, the notes of the following paragraph were taken as follows:
To have a healthier lifestyle, people need to do certain
things. First they should check their general health.
Measuring blood pressure and heartbeat is the most
important thing to do. They also need to check their
family health history. In this way, they understand if
anyone in the family has had a special illness.

. Read the following text.

Did you know that the things nobody needs can be used to produce
electricity, heat or fuel? Changing waste to energy can be considered
one of the most helpful ways to save the resources of the earth. Because
garbage can be changed directly into a liquid fuel, it can be used in cars,
trucks, buses and airplanes. To do that,garbage should be collectedand
taken to a landfill by workers. People may be paid for voluntary garbage
delivery as well. It is important to know that not all types of waste can
be used to produce fuel. Some materials may give off harmful gases in
the process. Therefore, people should be informed of this danger and
warned about the possible harms.
