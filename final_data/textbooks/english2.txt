مقدمه

با استعانت از الطاف خداوند متعال و عنایات حضرت ولي عصر (عج الله تعالي فرجه الشریف)
دومین جلد از مجموعه کتاب‌های Vision به منظور تدریس در پایهٔ یازدهم تحصیلی، تألیف
گردیده و هم اکنون پیش روی شماست. آموزش زبان‌های خارجی و به‌طور ویژه آموزش زبان
انگلیسی در نظام رسمی آموزش و پرورش کشورمان در سال‌های اخیر شاهد تحوّلی بنیادین
و اساسی بوده است که ریشه در تحوّل کلّی نظام آموزش و پرورش، اجرای سند برنامهٔ درسی
ملّی و سند تحوّل بنیادین نظام تعلیم و تربیت جمهوری اسلامی دارد و در چارچوب رویکرد
ارتباطی فعّال و خودباورانهٔ مورد تصریح در برنامهٔ ملّی محقّق شده است. در رویکرد ارتباطی
فعّال و خودباورانه، زبان‌های خارجی، از جمله زبان انگلیسی، به منظور ایجاد ارتباط با جهان
به شیوه‌ای فعّال و با تأکید بر ارزش‌ها و داشته‌های فرهنگ غنی اسلامی و ایرانی فراگیران
آموزش داده می‌شود.

تحوّل در آموزش زبان انگلیسی در قالب ارائهٔ مجموعه کتاب‌های English for Schools
و از سال تحصیلی ۱۳۹۲-۱۳۹۱ آغاز گشت. مجموعهٔ مذکور، دوره‌ای شش جلدی شامل
دو زیر مجموعهٔ سه جلدی با نام‌های Prospect و Vision می‌باشد. مهم‌ترین ویژگی‌های
رویکرد ارتباطی فعّال و خودباورانه و روح کلی حاکم بر مجموعه بسته‌های آموزشی Prospect
و Vision متکی بر اصول کلی زیر است:

توجه هم‌زمان به هر چهار مهارت زبانی (صحبت‌کردن، گوش دادن،خواندن و نوشتن)
استفاده از فعّالیت‌های آموزشی متنوع در فرایند یادگیری زبان
تأکید بر یادگیری زبان از طریق تجربیات زبانی

استفاده از محتوای غنی، معنادار و قابل فهم در تدوین محتوای آموزشی

ارتقای روحیهٔ فراگیری زبان در محیط مشارکتی و از طریق همکاری و همیاری در کلاس
ارائهٔ بازخوردهای اصلاحی مناسب به خطاهای فراگیران
توجه به جنبه‌های عاطفی و نقش آنها در فرایند آموزش زبان

----------

نکات قابل توجه دبیران گرامی:

نخستین توصیهٔ ما به همکاران گرامی این است که در آغاز تدریس این مجموعه، حتماً برنامهٔ
درسی ملّی و حوزهٔ مربوط به آموزش زبان‌های خارجی این سند را به دقّت مطالعه نمایند تا با
سمت و سو و سیاست‌های اصلی و مبنایی آموزش زبان‌های خارجی در این سند مهم که نقشهٔ
راه نظام آموزشی کشور است بیشتر آشنا شوند.

توصیهٔ دوم این است که کتاب‌های Prospect یک تا سه (دورهٔ اوّل متوسطه) را ملاحظه
نموده و با مطالعهٔ کتاب راهنمای معلم آن کتاب‌ها و مشاهدهٔ فیلم‌های آموزشی دبیران،
با عنوان «برفراز آسمان»، با اصول تدریس بر اساس رویکرد ارتباطی فعّال و خودباورانه،
آشنایی کامل پیدا کنند. مطالعهٔ کتاب‌های فوق به فهم دقیق سطح فعلی دانش آموزان، کمک
شایان توجهی می‌کند.

همچنین از همکاران گرامی خواهشمندیم کتاب راهنمای معلّم مربوط به کتاب
Vision 2 را با توجه و دقت هر چه تمام‌تر مطالعه نمایند. به این شکل بسیاری از پرسش‌ها
و ابهامات احتمالی دربارهٔ شیوهٔ تدریس کتاب، نحوهٔ زمان‌بندی و فعّالیت‌های جنبی برطرف
می‌شود. مجدداً تأکید می‌کنیم تدریس درست و مؤثر این کتاب بدون مطالعهٔ کتاب راهنمای
معلم آن، امکان‌پذیر نیست.

توصیهٔ دیگر، توجه به هر چهار مهارت زبانی، به صورت هم‌زمان است که تحقق این مهم
نیز مستلزم آشنایی با نحوهٔ صحیح تدریس و طراحی درسی دقیق می‌باشد. علاوه بر کتاب
راهنمای معلم، مشاهدهٔ نرم‌افزار و فیلم آموزشی معلمان با نام «بر فراز آسمان» نیز بسیار مفید
خواهد بود (در وبگاه گروه درسی زبان‌های خارجی یا شبکه ملّی مدارس «رشد» موجود است.)
همچنین شایسته است والدین نیز از تغییر و تحوّلات انجام شده در نظام آموزش زبان
انگلیسی آگاه گردند؛ به این منظور پیشنهاد می‌شود با استفاده از ظرفیت جلسات ویژهٔ تعامل
والدین با مدرسه،دربارهٔ این تحولات، اطلاع‌رسانی لازم انجام گیرد.

لازم به یادآوری است که مجموعهٔ غنی و کاملی از منابع مورد نیاز همکاران از جمله
فایل‌های تمامی اجزای بستهٔ آموزشی، مجموعهٔ دستورالعمل‌ها و آئین‌نامه‌های مربوطه و
جدیدترین اخبار و اطلاعات مورد نیاز همکاران گرامی از طریق وبگاه گروه زبان‌های خارجی
دفتر تألیف کتاب‌های درسی به نشانی زیر قابل دستیابی است که بازدید مرتب از این پایگاه نیز

----------

اکیداً توصیه می‌شود. یادآوری می‌گردد دبیران محترم و دانش‌آموزان می‌توانند فایل صوتی
کتاب درسی (کتاب گویا) را از وبگاه زیر تهیه نمایند.

Roshd.ir یا eng-dept.talif.sch.ir

در خاتمه مجدداً تأکید می‌شود که بستهٔ آموزشی حاضر با حاکمیت رویکرد ارتباطی فعّال و
خودباورانه، جنبه‌های متنوع نیازهای آموزشی دانش‌آموزان را در نظر داشته و در کنار کتاب
دانش‌آموز با ارائهٔ کتاب کار، کتاب راهنمای معلم، فایل صوتی کتاب (کتاب گویا) و همچنین
فیلم آموزش معلمان (بر فراز آسمان)، مجموعهٔ کاملی را در اختیار فراگیران قرار داده است.
نکتهٔ پایانی اینکه طبق ضوابط مصوّب وزارت آموزش و پرورش، در صورت نیاز، تنها استفاده
از کتاب‌ها و منابع کمک آموزشی تأیبد شده توسط طرح سامان‌بخشی کتاب‌های کمک
آموزشی دفتر تکنولوژی و انتشارات کمک‌آموزشی سازمان پژوهش و برنامه‌ریزی آموزشی
مجاز می‌باشد.

بی‌شک تحقق اهداف مورد نظر این بستهٔ آموزشی نیازمند حمایت‌های همه‌جانبه و ارزشمند
همکاران گرامی است که در سراسر ایران اسلامی با دلسوزی و تلاش فراوان، زمینهٔ رشد و
بالندگی آینده‌سازان میهن عزیزمان را فراهم می‌آورند، مؤلفان، این تلاش ارزشمند را ارج نهاده
و آرزومند اعتلای روزافزون نام مقدس جمهوری اسلامی ایران در تمامی عرصه‌ها هستند.

}) Langu4ges of the Worlq

Language is a system of communication. It uses written and spoken
forms. People use language to communicate with each other in a society.
They exchange knowledge, beliefs, wishes, and feelings through it.
Languages vary greatly from region to region. They are so different
that a person may not understand the language of Someone from
another region, country or continent. It is not surprising to hear that
today about 7000 languages exist in the world. There are more than
2000 languages in Africa, 1000 in the Americas, more than 2250 in
Asia, about 230 in Europe, and more than 1300 in Oceania.

Native speakers of these languages range in number from very
large, with hundreds of millions of speakers, to very small, with fewer
than 10 speakers. The most popular language in the world is Chinese.
More than one billion people in the world speak Chiese.

----------

Interestingly, English has fewer native speakers than Chinese, but there
are about one billion learners of English all around the world. They
learn English as an international language.

About fifty percent of the World's languages have fewer than 5000
speakers. In the beginning of the twenty-first century, 204 languages
had fewer than 10 speakers and 344 languages had between 10 and
99 speakers. The 548 languages with fewer than 99 speakers make up
nearly 8 percent of the world's languages. We call them 'endangered
languages'. As the speakers of such languages grow old and die, their
languages will die, too.

All languages are really valuable, despite their differences. Every
language is an amazing means of communication that meets the needs
of its own speakers. It is impossible to imagine the world without
language. Therefore, we should respect all languages, no matter how
different they are and how many speakers they have.

Scanning آ

You can scan a reading passage to look for and find specific
information quickly such as a number, a name, a word, or a phrase.
Follow these steps to scan:

l Make a clear picture in your mind of the information you
are looking for.

g Look for +hat information.

Move your eyes quickly across the text. Don't read every
word. When you find the information, stop, read the

SYNONYMS

Synonyms are words with similar meanings, for example, 'hard'and *difficult';

----------

eramma

. Read the following texts.

An endangered language is a language that has very few speakers.
Nowadays, many languages are losing their native speakers. When a
language dies, the knowledge and culture disappear with it. A lot of
endangered languages are in Australia and South America. Some of
them are in Asia and Africa. The number of live languages of the world
is around 7000, and many of them may not exist in the future. Many
researchers are now trying to protect endangered languages. This can
save lots of information and cultural values of people all around the
world,

There are many uncountable words for food in English. Native speakers
often use words such as 'a bag of, 'two slices of', or 'a piece of' with
uncountable nouns. This usually happens when they go shopping. They
may ask for two bottles of water, a bag of sugar, a loaf of bread, or
two kilos of meat. In a coffee shop, they may order a cup of tea, a piece
of cake, or a glass of juice. If a foreign learner uses uncountable words
wrongly, English speakers may not understand them well. So when you
learn English, be very careful about this important point.

----------

Simple Sentences

In English, every simple sentence must have at least a subject and a
verb. Such a sentence is called a 'simple sentence'. Who or what the

about the subject is called the verb. In the following sentences, the
subject is underlined once and the verb twice.

}) Hqvinq 4 Heqlthier anq Lonqer Life

Have you ever thought of a healthy lifestyle to live longer? People can
do many things to have a healthier life. Most people have a special diet
or do lots of exercise; however, without a careful plan they may hurt
themselyes,

To have a healthier lifestyle, people need to do certain things. First
they should check their general health. Measuring blood pressure and
heartbeat is the most important thing to do. They also need to check
their family health history. In this way, they understand if anyone in
the family has had a special illness.

Another thing is paying attention to physical health. For example,
eating healthy food helps
people live longer and
prevents diseases. Eatin
junk food makes people gain
weight, and increases the risk of
heart attack. Eating balancedservings

of bread, vegetables, fruits, protein, and oil

is necessary for everyone. Also, daily exercises
improve people's health Condition.

An effective way to enjoy a better lifestyle
is having healthy relationships with others.
Recent research has shown that a good social
life decreases the risk of death. Sadly, some
people do not visit their relatives very
often these days. They are really busy
with their work and usually use
technology to communicate.

----------

Bad habits and addiction Can be harmful to health. One day of
smoking can take around 5 hours away from the smoker's life.
Addiction to technology such as using computers for a long time is
also dangerous.

Above all, the most important thing to enjoy a good life is having
emotional health. Praying decreases stress and gives people a calm
and balanced life. People with this lifestyle have had a better life.
There are many other things people can do to live healthier and
longer. The key point, however, is having a plan for the way they want
to live and take care of their physical and emotional health.

. Read the following texts.

Technology has influenced the lives of people in this century. Working
with computers and mobile phones has changed people's habits and
lifestyles. Some people use their laptops and especially their mobile
phones everywhere for no good reason. Some of them have not read a
book for months. Some have not visited their relatives for a long time.
Some even have not slept well or have not eaten properly for a long time.
Some of these people have quit good habits like doing daily exercises or
attending social events. They have chosen an unhealthy lifestyle. To live
longer, they need to rethink the way they live, work, and use technology.

Technology has helped the researchers and scientists of our time. New
medicines and medical inventions have saved the lives of many people.
They have let people have a happy life and live longer. New medicines
such as anti-cancer drugs and new antibiotics have cured many patients.
Some technological inventions have helped doctors to check people's
health condition. They have found keys to the secrets of the human
body. New technologies have helped doctors to understand how diseases
develop. They have found ways to fight and stop diseases in their early
stages. Technology, as some people may think, is not a bad thing at all.
The way we use technology, is important.

Gerunds

Cycling is good exercise.
Vahid enjoys cycling.

A gerund is a verb + -ing that works like a noun. A gerund can be a
subject or an object in a sentence.

Swimming is useful for everyone.
= Reading helps us learn English.

A gerund is always singular. When one gerund is the subject of a sen-
tence, it takes a singular verb
=Walking makes me happy

But when two gerunds form the subject, the verb is plural
= Cycling and jogging are my favorite sports.
Sometimes a noun follows a gerund:
=Playing football was his fun.
=Taking photos is her hobby

=Learning a language takes time.

----------

A. Change the following verbs into gerunds. Then complete the sentences.

|  g   | w  |   |   |
| fast food makes you fat.  |   |   | 1)  |
| by train is cheap and safe.  |   |   | 2)  |
| English well is one of my goals.  |   | 3) ..........  ||
| regular exercise is useful for everyone.  | 4) ............  |||


In notices, you often see NO before -ing forms. It means
that it is forbidden here. For example, NO FISHING
means "Fishing is forbidden".

=I enjoy swimming.

= Maryam loves reading.

*We can use a gerund after the following verbs:

l۵۷e

*We usually use go + a gerund to describe recreational activities.
Let's go shopping.

=Yesterday, we went biking.
Here are some common examples:

go fishing
go skiing

go swimming

go skating
go jogging

go sailing

go running

C. Using gerunds (as subject and object) make five sentences about
yourself, your family or your friends.

Reza: The price depends on its size. Instead, you can take an Isfahan
Termeh or a Qashqai Gabbeh.

Tourist: Wow! How touching this Gabbeh is! How much is it?

It is 85 dollars. If you buy more than 100 dollars, you'll get
a 20 percent discount. You can take this calligraphic tile for
only 30 dollars.

Tourist: Well, I'll take both. Please pack them for me.
Yes, sure.

Tourist: Do you work for this shop? Who has made these beautiful
jtems?

Actually, it is my father's workshop and store. I work here
after school. All my family members work here to help our
family business.

Tourist: Well done! How lucky you are to work in such a lovely shop!
I really appreciate the culture and art of Iran.

Art, Culture and Societq

Art is what people create With imagination and skill. As a part of
culture, it shows the way of life and identity of a nation and reflects
the history of a society. In fact, the history of humankind is the history
of art. If we want to know a Country or a nation well, we should study
Handicrafts are good examples of the art and culture of a country.
By handicrafts, we mean making decorative items in a skillful way
using our hands. Each country and culture has its own handicrafts.
Making and selling handicrafts are good ways to help a country's
economy and introduce its culture to other nations. Many people of
the world produce handicrafts and sell them to tourists. In some Asian
countries a part of the country's income comes from making and
selling handicrafts.

Iran has a five-thousand-year-old history of artistic works and
handicrafts including pottery, painting, calligraphy, rugs and carpets,
etc. If you travel across
Iran, you'll get back
home with excellen

Iranian art is also quite famous all around the world. There are very
excellent collections of Persian art in many important museums of
the world, If we want to name countries with richest art and cultur
diversity, Iran is among them. Persian art is famous in the world for
reflecting moral and social values of Iranian people and the natural
beauty of this vast country.

Iranian craftsmen and craftswomen are famous for producing very
unique artworks from wood, metal and other simple materials around
them. Many people of the world appreciate the art and skill of a young
Iranian girl who weaves a beautiful silk carpet in a small village of
Azarbaijan or Kordestan. When tourists buy Persian rugs or carpets,
they take a part of Iranian art and culture to their homelands.

Our neighbor is a craftsman. I love his beautiful artworks.
Whenever I see his works, I say to myself, "when I grow u
I will become an artist like him". One day he told me: "Amir,
are you really interested in art? If you enjoy art, you will
become a good artist. Most people like art, but some do not
understand it. If you do not see any special thing in a pottery,
you won't appreciate its value. If you do not appreciate the
value of art, you cannot become a successful artist. You will
just make things. If you really like art, you will need two
things in the future: education and experience. Study hard,
work hard, and create things to make people happy."
