مقدمه

با استعانت از الطاف خداوند متعال و عنایات حضرت ولي عصر (عج الله تعالي فرجه الشّریف)
اوّلین جلد از مجموعه کتاب‌های Vision به منظور تدریس در پایهٔ دهم تحصیلی، تألیف
گردیده و هم اکنون پیش روی شماست. آموزش زبان‌های خارجی و به‌طور ویژه آموزش
زبان انگلیسی در نظام رسمی آموزش و پرورش کشورمان در سال‌های اخیر شاهد تحوّلی
بنیادین و اساسی بوده است که ریشه در تحوّل کلّی نظام آموزش و پرورش، اجرای سند
برنامهٔ درسی ملی و سند تحوّل بنیادین نظام تعلیم و تربیت جمهوری اسلامی دارد و در
چارچوب رویکرد ارتباطی فعّال و خودباورانهٔ مورد تصریح در برنامهٔ ملّی محقق شده
است. در رویکرد ارتباطی فعّال و خودباورانه، زبان‌های خارجی، از جمله زبان انگلیسی، به
منظور ایجاد ارتباط با جهان به شیوه‌ای فعّال و با تأکید بر ارزش‌ها و داشته‌های فرهنگ
غنی اسلامی - ایرانی فراگیران آموزش داده می‌شود.

تحوّل در آموزش زبان انگلیسی در قالب ارائهٔ مجموعه کتاب‌های English for Schools
و از سال تحصیلی ۱۳۹۲-۱۳۹۱ آغاز گشت. مجموعهٔ مذکور دوره‌ای پیوسته شامل دو
زیر مجموعه با نام‌های Prospect و Vision می‌باشد. مهم‌ترین ویژگی‌های رویکرد
ارتباطی فعّال و خودباورانه و روح کلی حاکم بر مجموعه کتاب‌های Prospect و Vision
متکی بر اصول کلی زیر است:

توجه هم‌زمان به هر چهار مهارت‌ زبانی(گوش‌دادن، صحبت کردن، خواندن و نوشتن)
= استفاده از فعّالیت‌های آموزشی متنوع در فرایند یادگیری زبان
تأکید بر یادگیری زبان از طریق تجربیات زبانی

= استفاده از محتوای غنی، معنادار و قابل فهم در تدوین محتوای آموزشی

ارتقای روحیهٔ فراگیری‌زبان در محیط مشارکتی و از طریق همکاری و همیاری در کلاس
ارائهٔ بازخوردهای اصلاحی مناسب به خطاهای فراگیران
توجّه به جنبه‌های عاطفی و نقش آنها در فرایند آموزش زبان

----------

نکات قابل توجه دبیران گرامی:

نخستین توصیهٔ ما به همکاران گرامی این است که در آغاز تدریس این مجموعه، حتماً
برنامه درسی ملی و حوزهٔ مربوط به آموزش زبان‌های خارجی این سند را به دقّت مطالعه
نمایند تا با سمت و سو و سیاست‌های اصلی و مبنایی آموزش زبان‌های خارجی در این سند
مهم که نقشهٔ راه نظام آموزشی کشور است بیشتر آشنا شوند.

توصیهٔ دوم این است که کتاب‌های Prospect یک تا سه (دورهٔ اوّل متوسطه) را ملاحظه
نموده و با مطالعهٔ کتاب راهنمای معلم آن کتاب‌ها و مشاهدهٔ فیلم‌های آموزشی دبیران،
با عنوان «بر فراز آسمان» با اصول تدریس بر اساس رویکرد ارتباطی فعّال و خودباورانه،
آشنایی کامل پیدا کنند. مطالعهٔ کتاب‌های فوق به فهم دقیق سطح فعلي دانش آموزان،
کمک شایان توجّهی می‌کند.

همچنین از همکاران گرامی خواهشمندیم کتاب راهنمای معلّم مربوط به کتاب
Vision1 را با توجّه و دقّت هر چه تمام‌تر مطالعه نمایند. به این شکل بسیاری از پرسش‌ها
و ابهامات احتمالی دربارهٔ شیوهٔ تدریس کتاب، نحوه زمان‌بندی و فعّالیت‌های جنبی برطرف
می‌شود. مجدداً تأکید می‌کنیم تدریس درست و مؤثر این کتاب، بدون مطالعهٔ کتاب
راهنمای معلّم آن، امکان‌پذیر نیست.

توصیهٔ دیگر، توجّه به هر چهار مهارت زبانی، به صورت هم‌زمان است که تحقّق این
مهم نیز مستلزم آشنایی با نحوهٔ صحیح تدریس و طراحی درسی دقیق می‌باشد. علاوه بر
کتاب راهنمای معلّم، مشاهدهٔ نرم‌افزار و فیلم آموزشی معلّمان با نام «بر فراز آسمان» نیز
بسیار مفید خواهد بود (در وبگاه گروه درسی زبان‌های خارجی و شبکه ملی مدارس (رشد)
موجود است).

همچنین شایسته است والدین نیز از تغییر و تحوّلات انجام شده در نظام آموزش زبان
انگلیسی آگاه گردند؛ به این منظور پیشنهاد می‌شود با استفاده از ظرفیت جلسات ویژهٔ
تعامل والدین با مدرسه، دربارهٔ این تحولات، اطلاع‌رسانی لازم انجام گیرد.

لازم به یادآوری است که دستیابی به مجموعهٔ غنی و کاملی از منابع مورد نیاز همکاران
از جمله فایل‌های تمامی اجزای بستهٔ آموزشی، مجموعهٔ دستورالعمل‌ها و آئین‌نامه‌های
مربوطه و جدیدترین اخبار و اطلاعات مورد نیاز همکاران گرامی و نیز ارتباط با گروه

----------

زبان‌های خارجی از طریق وبگاه گروه زبان‌های خارجی دفتر تألیف کتاب‌های درسی به
نشانی زیر، امکان‌پذیر است، لذا بازدید مرتّب از این پایگاه اکیداً توصیه می‌شود:
یادآوری می‌گردد دبیران محترم و دانش‌آموزان گرامی می‌توانند فایل صوتی کتاب درسی
(کتاب گویا) را از طریق یکی از وبگاه‌های زیر تهیه نمایند.

Roshd.ir یا eng-dept.talif.sch.ir

در خاتمه مجدداً تأکید می‌شود که بستهٔ آموزشی حاضر با حاکمیت رویکرد ارتباطی
فعّال و خودباورانه، جنبه‌های متنوّع نیازهای آموزشی دانش‌آموزان را در نظر داشته و در
کنار کتاب دانش‌آموز با ارائهٔ کتاب کار، کتاب راهنمای معلّم، فایل صوتی کتاب (کتاب گویا)
و همچنین فیلم آموزش معلّمان (بر فراز آسمان)، مجموعهٔ کاملی را در اختیار فراگیران
قرار داده است. نکتهٔ پایانی اینکه طبق ضوابط مصوّب وزارت آموزش و پرورش، در صورت
نیاز، تنها استفاده از کتاب‌ها و منابع کمک‌آموزشی تأیید شده توسط طرح سامان‌بخشی
کتاب‌های کمک‌آموزشی دفتر تکنولوژی و انتشارات کمک آموزشی سازمان پژوهش و
برنامه‌ریزی آموزشی مجاز می‌باشد.

بی‌شک تحقّق اهداف مورد نظر این بستهٔ آموزشی نیازمند حمایت‌های همه‌جانبه و
ارزشمند همکاران گرامی است که در سراسر ایران اسلامی با دلسوزی و تلاش فراوان،
زمینهٔ رشد و بالندگی آینده‌سازان میهن عزیزمان را فراهم می‌آورند، مؤلّفان، این تلاش
ارزشمند را ارج نهاده و آرزومند اعتلای روزافزون نام مقدّس جمهوری اسلامی ایران در
تمامی عرصه‌ها هستند.

Today, there are some endangered animals on Earth. It means that We
can find only a few of them around us. Some examples are whales,
pandas, tigers and Asian elephants.

Humans destroy the natural homes of the animals in the forests,
lakes, and plains. When the number of people on Earth increases, they
need more places for living. They cut down trees and destroy lakes.
They make homes and roads instead. Then the animals won't have a
place to live. They will die out.

The Iranian cheetah is among these animals. This wild animal lives
only in the plains of Iran. Now there are only a few Iranian cheetahs
alive. If people take care of them, there is hope for this beautiful
animal, to ljye,

Recently, families pay more attention
to nature, students learn about saving
wildlife, and some hunters don't go
hunting anymore. In this way, the
number of cheetahs is going to

Human knowledge develops with scientists' hard work. Many great
men and women try hard to find facts, solve problems and invent
things.

Some of these scientists did not have easy lives. But they tried hard
when they were working on problems. They never felt weak when they
were studying. They never gave up when they were doing research.
There are great stories about scientists and their lives. One such a story
is about Thomas Edison. As a young boy, Edison was Very interested
in science. He was very energetic and always asked questions. Sadly,
young Edison lost his hearing at the age of 12. He did not attend
school and learned science by reading books in the library himself.
When he grew up he worked in different places, but he never lost his
interest in making things. Edison was famous for doing thousands of
experiments to find answers to problems. He said, "I never quit until
I get what I'm after". Edison had more than 1,000 inventions
and was very successful at the end of his life.
Many great names had stories like this.
But the key to their success is
their hard work and beljef in
themselves. If you want to g
what you want, work hard
and never give up.

As a tourist, we should be careful about our behavior in a foreign
country. We must not break any rule if we want to have a good
and safe trip. We may not like a part of the host's culture, but we
should be polite to people and their values. We should not say bad
things about their food, dresses, or ceremonies. We can talk to
other people and try to understand them. We should also protect
nature and the historical sites of that country. We must not hurt
animals or plants. We should not write anything on buildings. Our
good behavior can give a good image of our country to other people.
They may want to come and see our country soon!
