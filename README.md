# IRUEX-dataset

This repository contains all datasets, prompts, and materials used in the IRUEX study, which investigates the
problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in the context of Iran’s University Entrance Exam. The
study aims to evaluate how well LLMs can handle the types of questions typically encountered in this high-stakes
examination, focusing on multiple subjects including mathematics, physics, etc.
